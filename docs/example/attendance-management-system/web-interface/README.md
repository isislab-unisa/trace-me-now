# Web interface

A web interface built from scratch using React provides access to all the data of the system, including employees' information and notifications responses. 

The web interface provides the list of all the employees, those within the workplace or who left it at least once, a section with all the employees' messages.
From this dashboard, an admin of the company can monitor the employees. It is provided a notification system that notifies when an employee arrives, when arrives in late, when leaves the company during or out the shift, and reasons reported by the employees when they are leaving the shift.
