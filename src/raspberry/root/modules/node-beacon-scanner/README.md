node-beacon-scanner
===============

The node-beacon-scanner is a Node.js module which allows you to scan BLE beacon packets and parse the packet data. This module supports iBeacon, Eddystone, and Estimote.

The supported beacon data formats are as follows:

* iBeacon
* Eddystone-UID
* Eddystone-URL
* Eddystone-TLM (Unencrypted)
* Eddystone-EID
* Estimote-Telemetry
* Estimote-Nearable

## Dependencies

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 6 +
* [@abandonware/noble](https://github.com/abandonware/noble)

See the document of the [@abandonware/noble](https://github.com/abandonware/noble) for details on installing the [@abandonware/noble](https://github.com/abandonware/noble).

Note that the noble has to be run as root on most of Linux environments. See the the document of the [@abandonware/noble](https://github.com/abandonware/noble) for details.

The early versions of this module depended on [noble](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble) for BLE handling. But the [noble](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble) seems not to support Node v10 or later versions. Now, this module is employing [@abandonware/noble](https://github.com/abandonware/noble), which was forked from [noble](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble). For the purouse of the backward compatibility, this module works with [noble](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble) on Node v8 or earlier versions.


## Installation

```
$ cd ~
$ npm install @abandonware/noble
$ npm install node-beacon-scanner
```

## <a id="Quick-Start">Quick Start</a>

This sample code shows how to start scanning and how to get parsed packets.

```JavaScript
const BeaconScanner = require('node-beacon-scanner');
const scanner = new BeaconScanner();

// Set an Event handler for becons
scanner.onadvertisement = (ad) => {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(ad, null, '  '));
};

// Start scanning
scanner.startScan().then(() => {
  console.log('Started to scan.')  ;
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

The sample code above will output the result as follows:

```
Started to scan.
{
  "id": "c7dfbfd9f64a",
  "address": "c7:df:bf:d9:f6:4a",
  "localName": null,
  "txPowerLevel": null,
  "rssi": -59,
  "beaconType": "iBeacon",
  "iBeacon": {
    "uuid": "B9407F30-F5F8-466E-AFF9-25556B57FE6D",
    "major": 21983,
    "minor": 57807,
    "txPower": 180
  }
}
...
```

---------------------------------------
## <a id="BeaconScanner-object">`BeaconScanner` object</a>

In order to use the node-beacon-scanner, you have to load the node-beacon-scanner module as follows:

```JavaScript
const BeaconScanner = require('node-beacon-scanner');
```

You can get an `BeaconScanner` constructor from the code above. Then you have to create an `BeaconScanner` object from the `BeaconScanner` constructor as follows:

```JavaScript
const scanner = new BeaconScanner();
```

The `BeaconScanner` constructor takes an argument optionally. It must be a hash object containing the properties as follows:

Property | Type   | Required | Description
:--------|:-------|:---------|:-----------
`noble`  | Noble  | option   | a Noble object of the [`noble`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/noble) module

The node-beacon-scanner module uses the [`noble`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/noble) module in order to scan the beacons coming from the BLE beacon device(s). If you want to interact other BLE devices using the noble module, you can create an `Noble` object by yourself, then pass it to this module. If you don't specify a `Noble` object to the `noble` property, this module automatically create a `Noble` object internally.

The sample code below shows how to pass a `Nobel` object to the `Linking` constructor.

```JavaScript
// Create a Noble object
const noble = require('noble');

// Create a Linking object
const BeaconScanner = require('node-beacon-scanner');
const scanner = new BeaconScanner({'noble': noble});
```

In the code snippet above, the variable `scanner` is a `BeaconScanner` object. The `BeaconScanner` object has methods as described in sections below.

### <a id="BeaconScanner-startScan-method">scartScan() method</a>

The `startScan()` method starts to scan advertising packets from BLE beacon devices. This method returns a `Promise` object.

Whenever a packet is received, the callback function set to the [`onadvertisement`](#BeaconScanner-onadvertisement-event-handler) property of the `BeaconScanner` object will be called. When a packet is received, an [`BeaconScannerAdvertisement`](#BeaconScannerAdvertisement-object) object will be passed to the callback function.

```JavaScript
// Set an Event handler for becons
scanner.onadvertisement = (ad) => {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(ad, null, '  '));
};

// Start scanning
scanner.startScan().then(() => {
  console.log('Started to scan.')  ;
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

### <a id="BeaconScanner-stopScan-method">stopScan() method</a>

The `stopScan()` method stops to scan advertising packets from BLE beacon devices. See the section "[`startScan()` method](#BeaconScanner-startScan-method)" for details.

### <a id="BeaconScanner-onadvertisement-event-handler">`onadvertisement` event handler</a>

If a callback function is set to the `onadvertisement` property, the callback function will be called whenever an advertising packet is received from a BLE beacon device during the scan is active (from the moment when the `startScan()` method is called, to the moment when the `stopScan()` method is called).

See the section "[`startScan()` method](#BeaconScanner-startScan-method)" for details.

---------------------------------------
## <a id="BeaconScannerAdvertisement-object">`BeaconScannerAdvertisement` object</a>

The `BeaconScannerAdvertisement` object represents an advertising data coming from the BLE beacon device. This object is just a hash object containing properties as follows. Note that the structure varies depending on the format of the beacon. You can know the format of the beacon from the value of the `beaconType` property.
