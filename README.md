# Trace Me Now

Trace Me Now is an open-source framework which helps developers in building their own IoT-based localization and tracking systems. Its aim is to let developers build systems capable of localizing and keeping track of people through their smartphones, using *Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)* technology. For doing that, Trace Me Now offers a client library -  available for Android only, with future developments will be available for iOS as well - that allows to transmit BLE packets in broadcast, which will be sensed by Raspberry Pi boards. In fact, this framework provides a library for Raspberry Pi boards too, which will allow to sense, localize, and keep track of the users' smartphones. Furthermore, Raspberry Pis will have to interact with a back-end, as the client as well. You can choose between building a serverless application or not. If so, you can choose AWS or Microsoft Azure as cloud provider; otherwise Trace Me Now offers you a python library for easily developing a server for an on-premise solution. Below are reported the two general architecture you can build by using this framework.

## Notification System

Notifications are handled through MQTT protocol. For each event, there are two MQTT topics (not in every case as you will see): one where the event is triggered and one where to notify what happened. Below are reported the default events:

| Event           	| Notification         	|
|:-:	|:-:	|
| device/new      	| notify/new           	|
| device/delete   	| notify/delete        	|
| device/location 	| notify/location/**uuid** 	|
| -               	| notify/position/**uuid** 	|
| -               	| notify/change/**uuid**   	|

- *device/new* is used to receive entering device and saving them into the system. If you want to receiv a notification every time a device enters into the system you can subscribe to notify/new.
- *device/delete* is used to know which device left and consequently update the system. If you want to receiv a notification every time a device leave the system you can subscribe to notify/delete.
- *device/location* is used to request the position of a specific device. If you publish the **uuid** on that topic you will receive its position on *notify/location/**uuid***, where **uuid** has to be changed with your deviceâ€™s **uuid**.

- if you subscribe to *notify/position/**uuid*** you will constantly receive updates of every move of the device with the specified **uuid**.

- if you subscribe to *notify/change/**uuid*** you will receive a notification every time the device with the specified **uuid** changes room/raspberry.

You can create any custom event-notification by specifying the event topic and the notification topic.

### Notification format

As said before, notifications are handled through MQTT protocol, so they are messages exchanged with Json format.

So, both Raspberry and back-end (either serverless or not) have to manage json messages and keep track of devices in a NoSQL database through json. Each device is represented as following

```json
{
    "uuid": "6B41805F-C5DB-47B6-9745-D96F42138D95",
    "lastPosition": "1.26",
    "lastSeen": "11:20",
    "raspberryId": "249bae15-9d9e-494a-8c74-8c510153d378",
    "roomNumber": "1"
}
```

- `uuid` stands for *Universally unique identifier* and, as the name suggests, it is used for uniquely identify each device.
- `lastPosition` is the distance (expressed in meter) of the device from the Raspberry Pi who has detected the device.
- `lastSeen` is the time when that device was last detected by the system.
- `raspberryId` is the identifier of the Raspberry Pi who has last identified that device, which is another **uuid**.
- `roomNumber` is the room where the device is actually in.

Now, for each different notification, some or even all of these values can be used.

### notify/new

```json
{ 
    "device": {
        "uuid": "6B41805F-C5DB-47B6-9745-D96F42138D95",
        "lastPosition": "1.26",
        "lastSeen": "11:20",
        "raspberryId": "249bae15-9d9e-494a-8c74-8c510153d378",
        "roomNumber": "1"
    }
}
```

### notify/delete

```json
{ 
    "device": {
        "uuid": "6B41805F-C5DB-47B6-9745-D96F42138D95",
        "lastPosition": "1.26",
        "lastSeen": "11:20",
        "raspberryId": "249bae15-9d9e-494a-8c74-8c510153d378",
        "roomNumber": "1"
    }
}
```

### notify/location/*uuid*

```json
{
    "lastPosition": "1.26",
    "roomNumber": "1"
}
```

### notify/position/*uuid*

```json
{
    "lastPosition": "1.26",
    "roomNumber": "1"
}
```

### notify/change/*uuid*

```json
{
    "fromRoom": "1",
    "toRoom": "2",
    "fromRaspberry": "249bae15-9d9e-494a-8c74-8c510153d378",
    "toRaspberry": "42D72473-47E6-4F6B-810A-5BD46BC35F9E"
}
```
